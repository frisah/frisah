<P>Yna
-this girl is my sisternemy, like a sister and an enemy in one word haha we’re sisters but we fight a lot. Even though we fight a lot, i love her so much. She’s my only sister so that makes me the breadwinner of the family. It takes a lot of pressure but I’m still trying my best to be the best sister and best daughter to them. We do fight sometimes, but we bond a lot and we have a lot in common. That is why she is also one of my favorite person of them all.
</P>

<p>Mama
-i can say that she is simply the best out of everyone well even though she’s my mom, she’s always second to lola hehe she’s also strict just like lola but she never fails to give us everything that we need and want. She’s the best mom ever! She became my all time favorite superhero because of her sacrifices with me and my sister. Even though she is now a single parent raising us, she didn’t make us feel like we’re a broken family. She’s a strong person and she also never fails to be a part time dad but full time mom with us. And i love her for that.
</p>

<p>Lola
-she’s the first person I’ve been really close with ever since i was born. I grew up with her because my mom is a midwife so usually she is not at home always. We bonded a lot, she sings me songs she know everytime me and my sister sleep in her house. She’s my favorite person of all! She’s a strict one just like every lola’s out there, but she’s different in so many ways. And i love the way she raise my mom and of course me and my sister. We grew up to be strong persons just like she always wants us to be.
